# pulguita-font

This typeface was created digitally from my own handwriting, carefully drawn and refined to preserve its personal character. Several glyphs were adjusted or redesigned to improve consistency and readability while keeping the natural flow of the original strokes. The result is a handwritten-inspired font that feels authentic, expressive, and clean enough for everyday personal use.

This font is intended exclusively for personal, non-commercial projects—such as journaling, school materials, mood boards, or creative experiments. It may not be used for branding, advertising, merchandise, or any project that involves commercial gain.

## EN - Handwritten-style font based on my own lettering, created for personal projects only. Not allowed for commercial or promotional use. 
## ES - Fuente basada en mi propia caligrafía, creada para uso personal. No está permitida para fines comerciales ni promocionales.
